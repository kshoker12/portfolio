# Summary
- **Goal:** Build a generative model to generate cohesive classical piano music during inference while allowing user to control generation by inputting desired attributes. 
- **Architecture ($\approx 44.2M$ Params):** Conditional Variational Auto-Encoder 
	- Encoder ($\approx19.6M$ Params): Embed music into low-dimensional latent space.
	- Latent Space: Low-Dimensional latent space with learned latent features.
	- Conductor ($\approx 1.88M$ Params): Auto-regressively generates condition embeddings for each musical bar conditioned on the latent representation. 
	- Decoder ($\approx 22.8M$ Params): Auto-regressively generates music conditioned on the condition embeddings. 
	- Attribute Embeddings: Musical features which also condition decoder. 
- **Comparison:** Compare generation quality to a baseline decoder-only transformer.
	- Negative Log-Likelihood on held-out test-set.
	- **Attribute Control Accuracy**: For each attribute (e.g., Note Density), generate $100$ samples across bins $0$–$7$ and calculate the Pearson correlation between the input bin and the measured stat in the output MIDI .
	- **Latent Space Topology**: Use $t$-SNE or UMAP to visualize the global latent space $z_p$. A successful model will show clusters based on composer or "musical mood" despite not being explicitly trained on labels.
	- **Diversity (Self-BLEU)**: Measure the overlap between generated pieces to ensure the model isn't just "averaging" the training data.
	- TODO: Find relevant metrics for comparison.
		- Need one for determining quality of attribute embeddings and that they actually control the conditioned model. 
		- Good organization of global latent space $Z$.
		- Cohesiveness of the music compared to normal transformer.
		- Generation quality. 
# Data
- **Datasets:** $500$ hours high-quality classical piano
	- MAESTRO - $200$ Hours (filtered)
	- GiantMIDI-Piano - curated $300$ Hours filtered to $4/4$ time signatures and preferred composers: Beethoven, Tchaikovsky, Chopin, Liszt, Schubert, Ravel, Debussy, Rachmaninoff + keywords “waltz”, “sonata”, “nocturne”, “theme”, “fantasia”, “etude”)
- **Pre-Processing** 
	- **Train/Val/Test Splits:** $80/10/10$
		- Train: full VAE architecture 
		- Val: ELBO for model selection/tuning 
		- Test: NLL for unbiased comparison (baseline vs. VAE)
	- **Time Signatures:** Dataset is strictly filtered to 4/4 (including equivalent 2/4 and 2/2) time signatures. This enforces a uniform bar structure (exactly 16 `Position` slots per bar), simplifies the GRU conductor's latent space, and guarantees predictable sequence lengths. `use_time_signatures=False`.
	- **Chunking**: Fixed $8$-bar chunks after stripping leading silence in initial bars $\tilde{X} = \textbf{split8bars}(\textbf{strip\_leading\_silence}(X))$. Chunks are then padded / dropped to fit `block_size`.
	- **Chunk-Quality Filtering (Strict):** After tokenization and chunking, each candidate 8-bar chunk is filtered out unless it passes all criteria below (computed from raw per-bar token statistics):
		- **Minimum Active Bars:** Keep only if at least **6 of 8** bars have `note_density > 0`.
		- **Minimum Total Onsets:** Keep only if total note onsets across the chunk is at least **40** (\(\sum_b \text{note_density}_b \ge 40\)).
		- **Leading Silence:** Drop if there are **2 or more** leading empty bars (prefix bars where `note_density == 0`).
		- **Minimum Rhythmic Activity:** Keep only if mean `rhythmic_intensity` across bars is at least **0.10**.
	- **Block Size:** A max `block_size` of $1024$. 
		- Songs $>$ `block_size` will be discarded to ensure model learns from data which ends on a `<Bar>` token. 
		- Songs $<$ `block_size` will be padded with `<PAD>` 
	- **12-Key Transposition Augmentation:** To maximize generalization and prevent the model from memorizing absolute pitch sequences, offline transposition is implemented prior to chunking.
		- **Purpose:** This shifts the learning objective from absolute pitch to relative harmony, forcing the model to learn intervals rather than specific MIDI values.
		- **Data Multiplier:** Each piece is transposed into all $12$ keys, effectively increasing dataset diversity to the equivalent of $\approx 6,000$ hours of training data based on the original 500-hour corpus.
		- **Attribute Invariance:** Controllable attributes (e.g., rhythmic density and note velocity) are pitch-invariant. Since these features describe performance dynamics rather than harmonic content, the pre-computed integer labels remain consistent across all transposed versions.
		- **Mechanism:** Transposition is applied at the beginning of the preprocessing pipeline at the piece level. Any transpositions that push notes outside the valid piano range ($21$–$108$) are discarded to preserve musical integrity and vocabulary consistency.
		- **Training Batch Sampling Note:** Because 12-key transposition creates near-duplicate sequences differing mainly in `Pitch_*` tokens, **sample at most 1 transposition per source chunk per batch** (or otherwise de-correlate batches) to avoid batches dominated by near-duplicates.
	- **Bar Token:** `<Bar>` token acts as a hard musical boundary. Upon seeing this token, the decoder switches to the correct bar-level condition vector $z_k$ at every bar transition. 
	- **Controllable Attributes:** Compute raw values for Polyphony Rate, Rhythmic Intensity, Velocity Dynamics, and Note Density in each kept $8$-bar chunk. Global quantiles are calculated across the **filtered training dataset** (i.e., only bars belonging to chunks that survive the strict chunk-quality filter) to map each feature into 8 standardized discrete levels ($0$–$7$). These pre-computed integer labels are saved with each chunk. At training time the DataLoader simply loads the binned indices, enabling zero-CPU-overhead lookup of learned attribute embeddings.
	- **Kaggle-Optimized Storage (Memmap):** To avoid CPU RAM bottlenecks on Kaggle, the final datasets are stored as **memory-mapped binary arrays** (streamable from disk) instead of monolithic PyTorch tensors:
		- `X` tokens: `uint16` memmap of shape \([N, 1024]\)
		- `bar_indices`: `uint8` memmap of shape \([N, 1024]\)
		- `attributes`: `uint8` memmap of shape \([N, 8, 4]\)
		- `meta.json`: records shapes, dtypes, and special token IDs (`pad_id`, `bar_id`)
		- **Target `Y` is not stored**: at training time, compute \(Y = \text{shift}(X)\) (i.e., `Y = X[:, 1:]` with `pad_id` appended to restore length 1024). This halves token storage.
- **Kaggle Feasibility:** AI Advice + Personal Experience. 
	- **Hardware**: Single T4 (16 GB VRAM) — use `fp16` mixed precision + `torch.cuda.amp.GradScaler()` + PyTorch native attention, batch size **$8$–$12$** (fits comfortably, no DDP needed).
	- **Training timeline**: $\approx45$–$60$ min/epoch; plan for **$40$–$50$ epochs** total ($\approx30$–$45$ GPU hours) across $2$ sessions (within weekly $30$-hour free quota).
	- **Workflow**: Save model + optimizer + epoch every $5$ epochs to /kaggle/working/ for easy resume (mandatory for stability).
# Tokens 
**REMI (Revamped MIDI):** Utilized the `miditok` library to encode music using the REMI representation. Unlike older methods that treat time as a fluid stream of milliseconds, REMI organizes music exactly like sheet music (explicit measures and beats). This provides hard `<Bar>` boundaries, which our hierarchical architecture relies on to swap the latent condition vectors ($Z_k$) at the start of every new measure.
**Vocab:** Musical Grammar consisting of $195$ tokens.  

| Token        | Example                     | Meaning                                                                                                                               | Vocab Size                                |
| ------------ | --------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| `<Bar>`      | `Bar`                       | Boundary token between bars and triggers decoder to switch bar-level latent $z_k$.                                                    | $1$                                       |
| `[Position]` | `Position_1`, `Position_16` | The note slot within the current bar                                                                                                  | $16$ (Fixed constant for $4/4$)           |
| `[Pitch]`    | `Pitch_60`                  | Specific Piano Key Pressed                                                                                                            | $88$ (Restricted to physical piano keys)  |
| `[Velocity]` | `Velocity_16`               | Loudness/dynamics                                                                                                                     | $32$ (Quantized bins)                     |
| `[Tempo]`    | `Tempo_120`                 | Tempo token (quantized). Enables reconstruction of expressive tempo changes during decode.                                            | $32$                                     |

| `<PAD>`      | `<PAD>`                     | Utilized to fill up chunks $<$ `block_size`                                                                                           | $1$                                       |
| `<BOS>`      | `<BOS>`                     | Indicates beginning of sequence                                                                                                       | $1$                                       |
**Example Sequence:**
```
<BOS> 
<Bar>
Position_0   Pitch_36 Velocity_28 Duration_4.0   // Deep bass C (Loud, rings for whole bar)
             Pitch_60 Velocity_20 Duration_4.0   // Middle C (Medium loud, rings)
             Pitch_63 Velocity_20 Duration_4.0   // E-flat (Medium loud, rings)
             Pitch_67 Velocity_20 Duration_4.0   // G (Medium loud, rings)
Position_12  Pitch_72 Velocity_10 Duration_0.5   // High C melody note (Soft, short)
<Bar>        // ... sequence continues for Bar 2
```
- **Beat 1 (The Downbeat):** The pianist plays a heavy, emotional C-Minor chord (4 notes simultaneously) and holds the sustain pedal down so it rings out for all 4 beats.
- **Beat 2 & 3:** The pianist's hands lift up. The chord continues to echo, but no new keys are pressed.
- **Beat 4:** A single, quiet, high melody note is played quickly (lasting half a beat).
- **Next Measure:** The next bar begins.
**Tokenizer Config (`miditok.REMI`):**
```python
config = TokenizerConfig(
    pitch_range=(21, 108),    
    beat_res={(0, 4): 4, (4, 8): 2},     
    num_velocities=32,    
    use_time_signature=False, 
    use_sustain_pedals=False,  
    use_tempos=True        
)
```
- `pitch_range = (21, 108)`: Restricts vocab to the 88 keys of a piano.
- `beat_res = {(0, 4): 4, (4, 8): 2}:` Fine timing for short notes inside a bar, coarser timing for long sustained notes (up to two bars). Keeps Duration vocabulary small and fixed at exactly 24 tokens.
- `num_velocities = 32`:  Quantizes raw MIDI volume into 32 discrete bins.
- `use_time_signature = False`:  Ignore `[Time-Sig]` tokens, assuming $4/4$ only. 
- `use_sustain_pedals = True`: Folds pedal events into `[Duration]` tokens.
- `use_tempos = True`: Preserves tempo changes for higher-fidelity MIDI reconstruction (adds 32 Tempo tokens to vocab).
# Attribute Embeddings
- **Attributes:** Each can be inferred from the raw MIDI notes of a song. 
	- Polyphony Rate: Allows controlling texture/chordal thickness (the average number of simultaneous notes playing at any given position).
	- Rhythmic Intensity: Allows controlling vibe (Calm vs. Intense).
	- Velocity Dynamics: Allows controlling volume (Loud vs. Soft).
	- Note Density: Allows controlling speed/activity (the total number of note onsets per measure).
- **Embedding Mechanism:** Each attribute is first binned into one of $8$ discrete levels ($0$–$7$) using global quantiles from the training set. These integer levels are passed through learned embedding lookup tables (`nn.Embedding`). Each attribute produces a $32$-dimensional vector; the four vectors are concatenated to form a single $128$-dimensional attribute condition vector $A_k$ for each bar. 
- **Integration:** $A_k$ ($128$-dimensional) is concatenated with the bar-level latent vector $z_k$ ($384$-dimensional) to produce the final **$512$-dimensional** condition vector $C_k = [z_k;\ A_k]$. This $C_k$ vector is injected into the decoder via Modulated In-Attention via FiLM at every layer and timestep. Maintaining this $3:1$ dimensional ratio physically forces the Decoder to prioritize the musical contour ($z_k$) over the physical attributes ($A_k$), preventing latent drowning.
- **Purpose:** These embeddings act as explicit, orthogonal control knobs (mixed-effect terms). By providing them directly, the VAE is relieved of the burden of encoding low-level rhythm/dynamics into the global latent $z_p$, allowing $z_p$ to focus purely on high-level harmonic and melodic identity. This enables intuitive user control at inference time while preserving musical coherence.
# Encoder
- **Encoder:** Takes input chunk $x$ and outputs parameters $\mu$ and $\sigma^2$, parameters of Gaussian Distribution, approximating the true posterior distribution $p(z_p | x)$ using a network $q_\phi(z_p |x)=\mathcal N(z_p; \mu, \sigma^2\mathbf I)$.
- **Purpose:** Compresses full musical context into a single global latent vector $z_p$ by looking forward and backward (bidirectional transformer), allowing encoder to figure out "global music identity" (overall mood, harmonic contour, melodic shape, structural feel). 
- **Reparameterization Trick:** $z_p = \mu + \sigma \odot \epsilon$, where $\epsilon \sim \mathcal N(0,\mathbf I)$ and $z_p$ is a deterministic transformation of fixed noise source $\epsilon$ which enables the gradient flow through $\mu$ and $\sigma$ during backpropagation. 
	- If you sample $z_p \sim \mathcal N(\mu,\sigma^2\mathbf I)$ directly, the sampling operation is stochastic and non-differentiable. Gradients cannot flow through the sampling step, so $\frac{\partial \mathcal{L}}{\partial \mu}$​ and $\frac{\partial \mathcal{L}}{\partial \sigma}$ become $0$ (or undefined). The encoder weights never receive a useful gradient from the reconstruction term in the ELBO.
- **Architecture:** Bidirectional Transformer $f_\phi$ (BERT-style) taking input chunk $x$ and outputting $f_\phi(x) = (\mu, \log \sigma^2) \in \mathbb R^{128}\times \mathbb R^{128}$. 
	- **Hyper-Parameters:** 
		- `n_layers`: $6$
		- `n_embed`: $512$
		- `n_head`: $8$ 
		- `feed-forward`: $4$ $\times$ `n_embed` $= 2048$  
		- `dropout`: $0.1$ (applied inside Transformer layers; no embedding dropout)
	- **Parameters ($\approx 19.6$ Million Total):**
		- **Token Embedding (`nn.Embedding(195, 512)`):** $195 \text{ tokens} \times 512 \text{ dims} = \mathbf{99,840} \text{ parameters}.$
		- **Positional Encoding (`nn.Embedding(1024, 512)`):** $1024 \text{ positions} \times 512 \text{ dims} = \mathbf{524,288} \text{ parameters}.$
		- **`[CLS]` Token (`nn.Parameter`):** A single learnable vector of size $512 = \mathbf{512} \text{ parameters}.$
		- **6 Transformer Layers (`d_model=512, n_head=8, d_ff=2048`):** Each layer contains:
		    - **Self-Attention:** 4 linear layers ($Q, K, V, \text{and Output}$). Each is $(512 \times 512 \text{ weights}) + 512 \text{ biases} = 262,656$. $\times 4 = 1,050,624 \text{ parameters}.$
		    - **Feed-Forward:** - Up-projection $(512 \rightarrow 2048)$: $(512 \times 2048) + 2048 = 1,050,624 \text{ parameters}.$
		        - Down-projection $(2048 \rightarrow 512)$: $(2048 \times 512) + 512 = 1,049,088 \text{ parameters}.$
		    - **Layer Normalization:** 2 norms per layer (pre-attention, pre-ffn). Each has $512 \text{ scale} (\gamma) + 512 \text{ shift} (\beta) = 1,024$. $\times 2 = 2,048 \text{ parameters}.$
		    - **Total per layer:** $3,152,384 \text{ parameters.}$
		    - **Total for 6 layers:** $6 \times 3,152,384 = \mathbf{18,914,304} \text{ parameters}.$
		- **Latent Projections (The Bottleneck):**
		    - **$\mu$ head (`nn.Linear(512, 128)`):** $(512 \times 128) + 128 = \mathbf{65,664} \text{ parameters}.$
		    - **$\log \sigma^2$ head (`nn.Linear(512, 128)`):** $(512 \times 128) + 128 = \mathbf{65,664} \text{ parameters}.$
	- **Initial Embedding & Positional Encoding:** Input tokens are first passed through a learned embedding table `nn.Embedding(vocab_size, n_embed)` to project discrete tokens into continuous space. Self-attention is permutation-invariant, we add a Learned Absolute Positional Encoding `nn.Embedding(block_size, n_embed)` to these token embeddings. While Relative Positional Encoding is popular in modern LLMs, it is computationally unnecessary here; our fixed $1024$ `block_size` pairs perfectly with Absolute encoding, and the REMI vocabulary (`[Position_X]`) already explicitly handles internal musical timing.
	- **Bidirectional Self-Attention:** No causal mask unlike decoder. Every token attends to every other token. 
	- **Sequence Pooling**: A learnable `[CLS]` token is prepended to the input sequence $x$. The transformer processes the sequence, and the final layer's hidden state at index $0$ (the `[CLS]` token) acts as the aggregated global representation. This single dense vector is passed through two parallel linear layers which conduct latent space projection:
		- `nn.Linear(n_embed, 128)`: Outputs the $\mu$ vector.
		- `nn.Linear(n_embed, 128)`: Outputs the $\log \sigma^2$ vector. Transform $\log \sigma^2$ to get $\sigma$ using $f(x) = \exp(0.5\cdot x)$.
- **Mathematical View:**
	- The bidirectional Transformer processes the full tokenized chunk $x$ (with a learnable `[CLS]` token prepended at the start):$$h = f_\phi(x) \quad \text{(full sequence of hidden states)}$$
	- The final-layer hidden state at the `[CLS]` position is extracted as the global representation $h_{\text{CLS}}$. This single vector is passed through two parallel linear heads:$$ \mu = \text{Linear}(h_{\text{CLS}}), \quad \log\sigma^2 = \text{Linear}(h_{\text{CLS}}) $$
	- The approximate posterior is then $$ q_\phi(z_p | x) = \mathcal{N}(z_p; \mu, \operatorname{diag}(\sigma^2)) $$ with $\sigma = \exp(0.5 \cdot \log\sigma^2)$.
# Conductor
- **Conductor (Deterministic Temporal Unrolling Network)**: The Conductor is a deterministic recurrent network that acts as the temporal Arranger. It translates the static, global latent blueprint ($z_p$) into a temporal sequence of $8$ measure-specific condition vectors ($z_k$).
- **Purpose:** The Conductor bridges the compact global representation $z_p$ with the detailed, temporally-aware guidance needed by the decoder. It is trained purely through the reconstruction loss (no KL term is applied to $z_k$).
- **Architecture:** $2$-layer Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) with hidden size $384$. 
	- **Hyper-Parameters:** 
		- `num_layers = 2` 
		- `hidden_size = 384`
	- **Parameters ($\approx 1.88$ Million Total):**
		- **Initialization Projection (`nn.Linear(128, 768)`):** $(128 \times 768) \text{ weights} + 768 \text{ biases} = \mathbf{99,072} \text{ parameters}.$
		- **Temporal Clock (`nn.Embedding(8, 384)`):** $8 \times 384 = \mathbf{3,072} \text{ parameters}.$
		- **2-Layer GRU (`input_size=384, hidden_size=384`):** PyTorch GRUs utilize $3$ gates (Reset, Update, New). The formula per layer is $3 \times (\text{hidden} \times \text{input} + \text{hidden} \times \text{hidden} + 2 \times \text{hidden})$.
		    - **Layer 1:** $3 \times (384^2 + 384^2 + 2\times384) = \mathbf{887,040} \text{ parameters}.$
		    - **Layer 2:** $3 \times (384^2 + 384^2 + 2\times384) = \mathbf{887,040} \text{ parameters}.$
	- **Input & Initialization:** The $128$-dimensional global latent $z_p$ is projected to $768$ dimensions via `nn.Linear(128, 768)` and then reshaped into two $384$-dimensional hidden states (one per GRU layer) to properly initialize the 2-layer GRU.
	- **Temporal Clock:** A learned bar embedding (`nn.Embedding(8, 384)`) is added at each step to explicitly tell the GRU its current position in the $8$-bar sequence.
	- **Output:** The GRU auto-regressively produces $8$ vectors $z_k$ (each $384$-dimensional). The entire sequence is deterministic given $z_p$.
- **Mathematical View:**
	- The 128-dimensional global latent $z_p$ is first projected and reshaped to initialize the two hidden states of the 2-layer GRU:$$h_0 = \text{Reshape}(\text{Linear}(z_p))$$with shape $(2, \text{batch}, 384)$, where $h_0^{(1)}$ and $h_0^{(2)}$ are the initial hidden states for layer 1 and layer 2 respectively.
	- For each bar $k = 1 \dots 8$:
	  $$h_k^{(1)} = \text{GRU}^{(1)}(\text{BarEmbed}_k, h_{k-1}^{(1)})$$
	  $$h_k^{(2)} = \text{GRU}^{(2)}(h_k^{(1)}, h_{k-1}^{(2)})$$
	  $$z_k = h_k^{(2)}$$

# Baseline: Simple VAE (Non-hierarchical)
- **Goal:** Provide a comparison point between the full **hierarchical** VAE and a standard **non-hierarchical** VAE while keeping the **same encoder and the same FiLM decoder** (matched capacity). This isolates the value of the Conductor and bar-level latent sequence $z_k$.
- **Key change (remove Conductor):** Instead of expanding $z_p \\rightarrow z_k$ with a GRU, we directly project the global latent to a decoder-aligned hidden vector:
	- $z_p \\in \\mathbb{R}^{128}$ (sampled via reparameterization as usual)
	- $z_g = \\text{Linear}(z_p) \\in \\mathbb{R}^{384}$ where `Linear: 128 -> 384`
	- Repeat across bars: $z_g$ is broadcast to shape $[B, 8, 384]$ (same value for each of the 8 bars)
- **Condition vectors:** Attributes are embedded exactly the same way to get $A_k \\in \\mathbb{R}^{128}$ per bar, then concatenate:
	- $C_k = [z_g; A_k] \\in \\mathbb{R}^{512}$
	- $C_k$ is broadcast to token timesteps using `bar_indices` (same as hierarchical VAE) and injected via FiLM at every decoder layer/timestep.
- **Training objective:** Identical ELBO training to the hierarchical VAE (PAD-masked reconstruction CE + KL with cyclical $\\beta$ annealing + KL free bits). This keeps the comparison fair: the only structural difference is the absence of the Conductor.
# Hierarchical Latent Space ($z_p \rightarrow z_k$)
- **Hierarchical Design:** The architecture deliberately separates a highly compressed global bottleneck from an expanded bar-level condition. This compact-to-expanded pipeline is the key to maintaining long-range musical coherence across all $8$ bars while still giving the decoder rich, bar-by-bar generation instructions. This design ensures $z_p$ remains a compact, semantically rich representation while $z_k$ provides the detailed, temporally-aware guidance the decoder needs.
- **Global Latent $z_p$ ($128$-dimensional):** This is the true, continuous VAE bottleneck. The bi-directional encoder compresses the entire $8$-bar chunk into this single vector.
	- **What it Encodes:** It strips away token-level specificities (exact notes and timing) and strictly encodes the high-level "global musical identity" of the whole piece: overall mood, stylistic character, harmonic language, melodic contour, and structural feel.
	- **Smoothness & Interpolation:** Because $z_p$ is regularized by the KL Divergence term of the ELBO loss to approximate a standard normal distribution $\mathcal{N}(0, \mathbf{I})$, the latent space is a completely continuous manifold. This allows for arithmetic operations; sampling a coordinate exactly halfway between two distinct $z_p$ vectors will decode into a coherent, novel sequence that musically interpolates the stylistic qualities of the two original sequences.
- **Bar-Level Latent $z_k$ ($384$-dimensional):** This is a deterministic sequence of vectors produced by the Conductor network given the global $z_p$.
    - **What it Encodes:** $z_k$ translates the abstract global style into localized, bar-specific instructions.
    - Dimensional Expansion: $z_p$ undergoes a linear projection (`nn.Linear(128, 768)`) and is then reshaped into two $384$-dimensional initial hidden states (one per GRU layer) before being fed into the Conductor GRU. The $128$-dimensional global bottleneck forces the VAE to learn foundational musical structure, while the expanded $384$-dimensional $z_k$ sequence mathematically matches the Decoder’s hidden dimension (`n_embed`) for clean Modulated In-Attention via FiLM conditioning.
# Decoder
- **Decoder:** Causal (autoregressive) Transformer that generates the next REMI token at each step, conditioned on the full history of previously generated tokens and the bar-level condition vectors $c_k$. 
- **Purpose:** The decoder is the generative core of the model. It takes the global style $z_p$ and bar-level guidance $z_k$ and $A_k$ and auto-regressively produces a coherent sequence of REMI tokens that form a complete musical piece.
- **Architecture:** $6$-layer Causal Transformer Decoder (GPT-style) utilizing a Modulated In-Attention via FiLM conditioning mechanism.
	- **Hyper-Parameters:**
	    - `n_layers`: $6$
	    - `n_embed`: $512$
	    - `n_head:` $8$
	    - `feed-forward`: $4$ $\times$ `n_embed` $= 2048$  
	    - `block_size:`$1024$ 
	    - `dropout`: $0.1$ residual dropout (after attention and after MLP); no embedding dropout
	- **Parameters ($\approx 22.8$ Million Total):**
		- **Token Embedding (`nn.Embedding(195, 512)`):** $195 \times 512 = \mathbf{99,840}$ parameters.
		- **Positional Encoding (`nn.Embedding(1024, 512)`):** $1024 \times 512 = \mathbf{524,288}$ parameters.
		- **6 Transformer Layers (`n_embed=512, n_head=8, d_ff=2048`):** Each layer contains:
		    - **Masked Self-Attention:** 4 linear layers ($Q, K, V, O$). Each is $(512 \times 512) + 512 = 262,656$. $\times 4 = 1,050,624$ parameters.
		    - **FiLM Generator ($\gamma, \beta$):** Two parallel linear heads `nn.Linear(512, 512)` to transform $C_k$ into scale and shift parameters. $2 \times ((512 \times 512) + 512) = \mathbf{525,312}$ parameters.
		    - **Feed-Forward:** - Up-projection: $(512 \times 2048) + 2048 = 1,050,624$ parameters.
		        - Down-projection: $(2048 \times 512) + 512 = 1,049,088$ parameters.
		    - **Layer Normalization:** 2 norms per layer. Each has $512$ scale + $512$ shift = 1024. $\times 2 = 2,048$ parameters.
		    - **Total per layer:** $\mathbf{3,677,696}$ parameters.
		    - **Total for 6 layers:** $6 \times 3,677,696 = \mathbf{22,066,176}$ parameters.
		- **Output Logit Head (`nn.Linear(512, 195)`):** $(512 \times 195) + 195 = \mathbf{100,035}$ parameters.
    - **Condition Vectors (Input):** For each bar $k$, the $384$-dimensional bar latent $z_k$ and $128$-dimensional attribute vector $A_k$ are concatenated to form the $512$-dimensional condition vector $C_k = [z_k;\ A_k]\in \mathbb R^{512}$. 
    - **FiLM Conditioning Mechanism:** To heavily enforce the condition without the overhead of Cross-Attention, $C_k$ is injected via FiLM. At every layer and timestep, $C_k$ generates a scale ($\gamma$) and shift ($\beta$) vector that modulates the hidden state element-wise before the self-attention operation:
		- $\gamma(C_k) = \text{Linear}_{\gamma}(C_k)$
		- $\beta(C_k) = \text{Linear}_{\beta}(C_k)$
		- $\tilde{h}_l^t = \gamma(C_k) \odot h_l^t + \beta(C_k)$
		- Applied at **every layer**, this multiplicative interaction ensures the hierarchical guidance cannot be simply ignored or bypassed by the Transformer's internal residuals, preventing latent drowning.
	-  **Output:** At each position, a linear head projects the final hidden state to vocabulary logits ($195$), followed by softmax to produce the probability distribution over the next REMI token.
- **Mathematical View:**
    - For each timestep $t$ and layer $l$ belonging to bar $k$:
        - Modulation:
        $$\tilde{h}_{l-1}^t = \gamma(C_k) \odot h_{l-1}^t + \beta(C_k)$$
        - Transformation:
        $$h_l^t = \text{TransformerBlock}_l(\tilde{h}_{l-1}^t)$$
    - The final hidden state of the last layer $L$ is projected to logits to determine the next token:$$p_{\theta}(x_t \mid x_{<t}, z_p, A) = \text{Softmax}(\text{Linear}(h_L^t))$$

# Baseline: Plain Transformer Decoder (Decoder-Only)
- **Goal:** Provide a **fair baseline** against the full VAE by using a decoder-only Transformer with **the same causal Transformer capacity** as the VAE decoder, but **without any latent variables** ($z_p$ or $z_k$) and **without the Conductor**.
- **Conditioning:** The baseline is conditioned **only** on the user-controllable per-bar attribute vectors $A_k$ (Polyphony, Intensity, Velocity, Density). This isolates how much attribute-only FiLM conditioning can control generation without hierarchical latents.
	- Attribute bins are integers $0$–$7$ per bar, shape \([8, 4]\).
	- Each attribute is embedded to 32-D and concatenated: \(A_k \in \mathbb{R}^{128}\).
	- \(A_k\) is projected to a 512-D FiLM condition vector \(\hat{C}_k \in \mathbb{R}^{512}\) to match the decoder hidden size.
- **Architecture (matched to VAE decoder):** $6$-layer GPT-style causal Transformer with:
	- `n_layers=6`, `n_embed=512`, `n_head=8`, `d_ff=2048`, `block_size=1024`
	- Learned token embedding + learned absolute positional embedding
	- FiLM modulation applied at every layer/timestep using the bar-aligned attribute condition \(\hat{C}_{k(t)}\) (aligned via `bar_indices`).
	- Residual dropout: $0.1$ (after attention and after MLP); no embedding dropout
- **Training objective:** Standard next-token prediction with **PAD-masked cross-entropy** (do not train on `<PAD>` tokens). This ensures padding does not dominate loss/gradients and keeps the baseline comparable to the VAE decoder’s reconstruction objective.
# Training Objective (The ELBO Loss)
- **Training Paradigm:** The model is trained end-to-end using teacher forcing. The objective is to maximize the Evidence Lower Bound (ELBO) of the data, which mathematically translates to minimizing a composite loss function comprising two distinct terms: Reconstruction Loss and KL Divergence (with Annealing).
- **Loss Formulation:**  $$ \mathcal{L}_{\text{Total}} = \mathcal{L}_{\text{Recon}} + \beta \cdot \mathcal{L}_{\text{KL}} $$
	- **Reconstruction Loss ($\mathcal{L}_{\text{Recon}}$)**  
		- **Purpose:** Ensures the Decoder accurately recreates the original REMI sequence given the latent variables.  
		- **Mechanism:** Standard auto-regressive next-token prediction. It is calculated using Categorical Cross-Entropy loss between the Decoder's output logits and the ground-truth sequence $X$.  
		- **Math:**  
		$$ \mathcal{L}_{\text{Recon}} = -\mathbb{E}_{q_\phi(z_p|x)} [\log p_\theta(X \mid z_p, A)] $$  
		(where the decoder is conditioned on the full hierarchical vector $C_k = [z_k; A_k]$ at every bar via Modulated In-Attention via FiLM).
	- **Regularization Loss & Cyclical β-Annealing ($\mathcal{L}_{\text{KL}}$)**  
		- **Purpose:** Regularizes the global latent space $z_p$ ($128$-dimensional) to approximate a standard normal prior $\mathcal{N}(0, I)$, ensuring the space is continuous and smoothly interpolatable.  
		- **The Posterior Collapse Threat:** Because the Decoder is a powerful autoregressive Transformer, it is highly susceptible to posterior collapse (ignoring $z_p$ entirely and relying solely on causal history).  
		- **The Cyclical β-Annealing Solution:** We utilize a **cyclical schedule**. Over $40$ epochs, $\beta$ will complete $4$ cycles ($10$ epochs each). In each cycle, $\beta$ ramps from $0.0$ to $0.1$ for $5K$ iterations and stays at $0.1$ for $5K$ iterations . This "shocks" the model into re-learning latent dependencies periodically.
		- **KL Free Bits (Hinge Loss)**: To prevent **Posterior Collapse**, we apply a "free bits" threshold $\lambda$ **per latent dimension after batch-averaging**, which is more stable than hinging per-sample:
		$$\mathcal{L}_{KL} = \sum_{i=1}^{128} \max\Big(\mathbb{E}_{x \sim \text{batch}}\big[D_{KL}(q_\phi(z_p^i \mid x) \parallel \mathcal{N}(0, 1))\big], \lambda\Big)$$
		We set $\lambda = 1.0$ bit (converted to nats in code). This ensures the model is not penalized for using the latent space up to a certain complexity, preserving the "information budget" of each dimension while keeping training stable.
- **Training Hyperparameters (Kaggle T4 Feasibility)**  
	- **Optimizer:** AdamW (`lr = 3e-4`, `weight_decay = 0.01`).  
	- **Precision:** Mixed Precision (FP16) using `torch.cuda.amp.GradScaler()` to maximize batch size on the $16$ GB T4 GPU.  
	- **Batch Size:** $8$ to $12$ (maximum that fits in VRAM without OOM).  
	- **Schedule:** Train for ≈$100K$ iterations. 
	- **LR Scheduler:**`torch.optim.lr_scheduler.CosineAnnealingLR(optimizer, T_max=50, eta_min=1e-5)` (decays from `3e-4` to `1e-5` over the full $100K$ iterations).
- **Temporal Alignment: GPU-Optimized Condition Broadcasting:** Since $z_k$ is dynamically sampled during the forward pass, $C_k$ cannot be precomputed offline without breaking the gradient graph. To prevent CPU bottlenecks during training, alignment is handled via **upfront index pre-computation**.
	- During data preprocessing, an integer tensor (`bar_indices`) is created for every sequence, mapping each token to its corresponding measure index (0 to 7).
	- During the forward pass, the Conductor generates the `[batch, 16, 384]` latent sequence. PyTorch advanced indexing (`Z[:, bar_indices]`) is used to instantly broadcast the condition vectors across the $1024$-token sequence in a single, highly optimized CUDA operation. This guarantees perfect temporal alignment with zero Python `for`-loop overhead.
- **Offline Data Preprocessing (Raw MIDI $\rightarrow$ .pt files):** Goal is to convert $500$ hours of MIDI into zero-math, ready-to-train integer tensors to bypass Kaggle CPU bottlenecks.
	- Parse & TokenizeFilter raw MIDI strictly to $4$/$4$ time.
		- Tokenize using `miditok` into the $195$-token REMI vocabulary.
		- Slice into exact $8$-bar chunks. 
		- Drop chunks $> 1024$ tokens; `<PAD>` chunks $< 1024$ tokens.
	- Extract & Encode Tensors: For every $8$-bar chunk, generate four exact integer arrays:
		- $X$ (Input): $[1024]$ integer array of REMI tokens.
		- $Y$ (Target): $[1024]$ integer array ($X$ shifted by $1$ for autoregressive next-token prediction).
		- `bar_indices`: $[1024]$ integer array mapping every token in $X$ to its corresponding measure ($0$–$14$). Used for instant $C_k$ broadcasting.
		- $A$ (Attributes): Compute the $4$ raw metrics per bar (Polyphony, Intensity, Velocity, Density). Globally quantize them into 8 discrete integer bins ($0$–$7$). Shape: $[8, 4]$.
	-  Save & Serve
		- Batch these 4 arrays and save to disk as flat PyTorch files (e.g., batch_001.pt).
		- Result: During training, the DataLoader does absolutely no math. It simply loads .pt files and instantly passes `[x, y, bar_indices, attributes]` to the GPU.
- **Training Health & Diagnostics:** To ensure the model is utilizing the latent space and avoiding **Posterior Collapse**, we will track the following metrics in real-time (via `WandB` or `TensorBoard`):
	- **KL Capacity**: Monitor the average KL bits per dimension. If $D_{KL} \rightarrow 0$ across all dimensions, the Decoder is ignoring $z_p$.
	- **Reconstruction Delta**: Monitor the drop in Cross-Entropy loss during the $\beta = 0$ portion of the cyclical annealing. A lack of improvement here indicates the Decoder is too weak.
	- **Active Units**: Count dimensions where $D_{KL} > \lambda$. A healthy model should have multiple active latent dimensions contributing to the musical structure.

# Evaluation (final protocol)

This project’s evaluation is designed to be **simple, reproducible, and high-signal** while directly testing the model claims:

- **(E1) Reconstruction accuracy + latent usage** on the **held-out test split**
- **(E2) Attribute controllability** (quantitative bins + correlations + disentanglement)
- **(E3) Latent space organization** (UMAP visualization + one quantitative score)

All evaluation code is implemented as Kaggle-style notebooks under `kaggle/notebooks/` and writes plots + machine-readable JSON under `artifacts/`.

## E1 — Test-set reconstruction accuracy + KL usage

**Applies to:** Plain Transformer (recon only), Simple VAE (recon + KL), Hierarchical VAE (recon + KL).

**Metrics (test split):**

- **PAD-masked reconstruction cross-entropy / NLL** (token CE with `<PAD>` ignored)
- **Per-token perplexity**: \(\text{PPL} = \exp(\text{CE})\)
- **For VAEs only:** **true KL bits/dim** (not clamped by free-bits) + histogram across dimensions
- **For VAEs only:** **active units** = number (or %) of latent dimensions with KL bits/dim above a threshold (default: the same \(\lambda\) used for KL-free-bits, converted to bits)

**Implementation notes:**

- Evaluate using **teacher forcing** on the test memmap split.
- Report mean/median and (optionally) confidence intervals via batch resampling.

## E2 — Attribute controllability (accuracy + correlation + disentanglement)

**Goal:** show that the learned attribute embeddings \(A_k\) act as reliable control knobs for **Polyphony**, **Rhythmic Intensity**, **Velocity Dynamics**, and **Note Density** (each binned 0–7).

**Generation protocol (per model):**

- For each attribute \(a \in \{\)polyphony, intensity, velocity, density\(\}\) and requested bin \(b \in \{0,\dots,7\}\):
  - Generate \(N\) samples with \(a=b\)
  - Hold the other 3 attributes fixed to a baseline bin (default: 3)
  - Keep decoding settings fixed (temperature, top-p, block size, bars per sample)
- Default \(N=50\) (scale to \(N=100\) if runtime allows)

**Measurement protocol (per generated sample):**

- Recompute the **raw per-bar attribute statistics** from the generated MIDI using the **same definitions used in preprocessing**
- Map each raw statistic back to a bin using the same **global quantile edges** (`quantiles.json` / equivalent)

**Reported metrics (per attribute, per model):**

- **Spearman** and **Pearson** correlation between requested bin and measured raw statistic
- **Exact-bin accuracy** and **±1-bin accuracy**
- **Confusion matrix** (requested bin vs measured bin)
- **Disentanglement check:** when sweeping one attribute, measure how much the **other attributes** change (correlations / slopes should be near 0 for ideal disentanglement)

## E3 — Latent space visualization + simple quantitative score

**Applies to:** VAEs (Simple + Hierarchical).

**Protocol:**

- Encode a large subset of the test split and collect **encoder mean \(\mu\)** vectors for \(z_p\) (128-D).
- Dimensionality reduction: **PCA → UMAP (2D)**.
- Color UMAP points by:
  - attribute bins (polyphony/intensity/velocity/density), and
  - dataset metadata (e.g., composer/source) if available.

**Quantitative add-on (one score):**

- **kNN label purity** in latent space for at least one available label (dataset source or composer).
# Inference
- **Music Generation:** The primary goal is to generate a short, coherent classical piano piece ($8$ bars \(\approx 12\)–\(32\) seconds depending on tempo) from a sampled global latent vector, while giving the user full real-time control over musical attributes.
- **Controllable Attributes (The Phased UI):** Attribute embeddings $A_k$ ($128$-dimensional) act as explicit, orthogonal control knobs. Each of the four attributes (Polyphony, Intensity, Velocity, Density) is binned into $8$ levels ($0$–$7$).
	- The UI exposes these controls and supports **1 or 2 phases**. For an $8$-bar piece, the user can set Phase 1 (bars $1$–$4$) to "low density", Phase 2 (bars $5$–$8$) to a loud crescendo. This creates a natural musical arc without requiring model retraining.
- **Inference Process (Step-by-Step)**
	1. **Prior Sampling:** Sample a global latent vector $z_p \sim \mathcal{N}(0, I)$ from the prior. _(Note: Users can also spherically interpolate between two known $z_p$ vectors)._
	2. **Temporal Unrolling:** Pass $z_p$ through the deterministic $2$-layer GRU Conductor to obtain the sequence of $8$ bar-level latent vectors $z_{1:8}$.
	3. **Condition Formulation:** For each bar $k$, construct the condition vector $C_k = [z_k; A_k]$ by concatenating $z_k$ with the user-specified phased attribute vector $A_k$.
	4. **Autoregressive Generation:** Start the Decoder with a `<BOS>` token. At every step, the Decoder processes the token history and the current condition vector $C_k$ via **Modulated In-Attention via FiLM**.
	5. **Grammar Masking:** To guarantee musically legal output without post-hoc repair, the tokenizer’s vocabulary constraints are enforced before sampling. Logits of invalid tokens are masked to $-\infty$.
		- `<Bar>` must be followed by `[Position]`
		- `[Pitch]` must be followed by `[Velocity]`.
	6. **Dynamic Switching:** When the model naturally generates a `<Bar>` token, the Python inference loop catches it, increments the bar counter, and physically switches the injected condition vector to $C_{k+1}$ for the subsequent tokens.
	7. **Rendering:** Stop after $8$ `<Bar>` tokens or the $1024$-token limit. Detokenize the sequence back to a MIDI file using `miditok`, and render to audio using `pretty_midi` and `FluidSynth`.
- **Mathematical View:** 
	- A single piece $X = (x_1, \dots, x_T)$ is generated as:$$z_p \sim \mathcal{N}(0, I)$$$$\{z_k\}_{k=1}^{8} = \text{Conductor}(z_p)$$$$x_t \sim p_\theta(x_t \mid x_{<t}, C_{k(t)}) \quad \text{where } C_k = [z_k; A_k]$$
	- Here, $k(t)$ is the bar index of token $t$, determined strictly on-the-fly by counting the number of previously generated `<Bar>` tokens. The full joint probability is:$$p_\theta(X \mid z_p, A) = \prod_{t=1}^T p_\theta(x_t \mid x_{<t}, C_{k(t)})$$
- **Important Considerations** 
	- **Temperature & Nucleus Sampling:** Sampling is performed token-by-token. A softmax temperature ($\tau \approx 1.0$) and nucleus sampling (Top-$p \approx 0.9$) are used to maintain diversity while preventing gibberish.
	- **Reproducibility:** By seeding the random number generator and saving the sampled $z_p$ and $A_k$ UI settings, any generated piece can be exactly reproduced later.
	- **Deployment & Inference Architecture:** The user interface will be deployed as a modern React web application (built with Vite). The frontend will capture the user's phased attribute settings and send an asynchronous request to a containerized Python backend (FastAPI + Docker). The specific cloud hosting platform for the inference container is currently TBD, but will be selected to optimally handle the model's autoregressive generation payload. Once the backend generates the sequence, it is detokenized via `miditok` and rendered to audio in the browser using `pretty_midi` and FluidSynth.
# Future Work & Extensions
- **Phase 2: Adversarial Latent Disentanglement ($\mathcal{L}_{\text{Adv}}$):** While the base model relies on the 2:1 condition ratio and $\beta$-annealing to separate high-level style from low-level attributes, there remains a risk of **latent entanglement**. The Encoder might still implicitly encode low-level dynamics (like note density or velocity) into the global latent $z_p$, creating conflicting signals when a user adjusts the attribute knobs during inference. To mathematically force $z_p$ and the Attribute Embeddings ($A_k$) to be orthogonal (disentangled), future iterations will implement a **Gradient Reversal Layer (GRL)**. 
	- **Satisfiability Test:** Validate need by using a fixed $z_k$ and testing with varying $A_k$ to see if outputted song style changes. 
	- **Mechanism:** A small auxiliary Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) Discriminator will be introduced during training. The Discriminator takes $z_p$ as input and attempts to classify the ground-truth attributes $A$.
	- **The GRL Integration:** We apply a Gradient Reversal Layer between the Encoder and the Discriminator. While the Discriminator minimizes its classification error, the reversed gradients actively penalize the Encoder for leaking attribute data.    
	- **Result:** The Encoder is forced to strip all rhythmic and dynamic information out of $z_p$, leaving it to encode _only_ high-level harmonic identity. This guarantees that the user's UI controls ($A_k$) act as strictly independent generation variables.
- **Guided Generation via Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS):** Currently, the autoregressive Decoder relies on Nucleus (Top-$p$) and Temperature sampling. While effective, standard left-to-right sampling is susceptible to error accumulation (where one bad token derails the entire subsequent measure). To optimize for global musical coherence, inference could be upgraded using a **Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS)** decoding strategy.
	- **The Value Function:** We would train an auxiliary "Critic" network (or utilize a pre-trained music quality metric) to act as the value function. This Critic evaluates the musicality, harmonic consistency, and adherence to the condition vector $C_k$ of a partially generated sequence.    
	- **The Search Process:** Instead of greedily picking the next token, the Decoder would simulate multiple future rollouts (branches). The MCTS algorithm balances exploration (trying rare tokens) with exploitation (following high-probability paths), guided by the Critic's reward scores.
	- **Result:** This transforms generation from a reactive, step-by-step prediction into a forward-planning search, heavily reducing hallucinated dissonances and ensuring complex musical cadences resolve properly over long time horizons.
- **Attribute control validation (project TODO)**: Compute per-bar stats on generated vs. real (polyphony, density, etc.) and report correlation with input bins. This directly addresses “quality of attribute embeddings” and is easy to implement with `miditok`/`pretty_midi`. For latent-space organization, plot t-SNE of $z_p$ coloured by composer/genre.
