  const aboutMe = ["I am a third-year student at the University of British Columbia (UBC), specializing in Computer Science and Statistics. From an early age, I was captivated by the challenge of solving puzzles and intricate riddles. This passion evolved into a profound appreciation for computer science when I discovered the sophisticated logic and problem-solving involved in developing software solutions. It was then that I found my calling in software development and AI engineering.", "Through completing ambitious projects and gaining valuable experience in my first role as a software developer, I realized that this field aligns naturally with my abilities and aspirations. This realization has fueled my ambition to contribute meaningfully to the ongoing technological revolution, driving innovation rather than being a mute spectator.", "Beyond academics and professional endeavors, I am committed to maintaining a well-rounded lifestyle. My hobbies include engaging in software and machine learning projects, playing chess to sharpen my strategic thinking, and practicing boxing to promote physical health and mental resilience."]
